    <p id="telosText">At the apex of the pyramid, we have the teleological aspect of WCHS: our goals as a school.  These are captured in our Core Values, our Mission Statement, and our Vision Statement.  In the terms of current sociological terminology, these ends and goals are linked to “human flourishing.” Our Core Values, our Mission Statement, and our Vision Statement were developed by a team of board members, administrators, faculty, and parents a number of years ago. They are posted all over the school, we have tasks to complete that address the core values; that is, we are quite familiar with them.  In some ways, they describe characteristics that (hopefully) define our school.  Mostly, though, they describe the ideal WCHS graduate.  We intend them to be visible in the lives of our students.  The rest of the pyramid suggests how that happens.</p>

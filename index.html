    <h1>What is Faithful Teaching</h1>
    <p>Faithful teaching has to do with the practice of fidelity in all areas of my teaching. This includes faithfulness to God, to other believers, to unbelievers, and even to the earth.</p>
    <p>Teaching encompasses much more than just disseminating information. Typically, the question of Biblical integation comes up in Christian schools. A lot of confusion ensues due to a lack of clarity regarding what that means. For example, many teachers think about how they can bring a Bible verse or theme into a particular lesson. That isn't a bad thing to consider, but it doesn't address the full depth of what it means to be a Christian teacher. There is so much more. As a result, Whittier Christian High School has adopted the language of "Faithful Teaching".</p>
    <P>I believe that the language of faithful teaching is better because it begs the question, "How is my teaching intentionally faithful to the gospel?" This is much better than just asking how my lessons differs from that of a non-believer. In some ways, the content and the methods may be quite similar. In other ways, they may be quite different. But, difference alone is not the goal, fidelity to the gospel is. This fidelity to the gospel leads me to think about who I teach, how I teach, and what I teach.</P>
    <h2>Who I Teach</h2>
    <p>Who am I teaching? This is an incredibly profound question that has a tremendous impact on how and what I teach. So, who am I teaching? I am teaching students who are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Created by God</li>
      <li>Image bearers</li>
      <li>Loved by their Creator</li>
      <li>Given talents/gifts/abilities</li>
      <li>Full of creative potential</li>
      <li>Relational</li>
      <li>Discoverers</li>
      <li>Fallen</li>
      <li>Bent toward sin</li>
      <li>Emotionally broken</li>
      <li>Insecure</li>
      <li>Some are rebelious</li>
      <li>Some have received forgiveness</li>
      <li>etc, etc, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>What I Teach</h2>
    <p>What I teach addresses more than just the content. It invokes questions of an epistemological nature. What is knowledge? What can we know? Is all truth God's truth? Can all people, believers and unbelievers discover truth in the same way? What counts as knowledge and evidence? What about revelation? How does the fall impact my student's ability to reason? How do the answers to these questions intersect with my curriculum and/or the broader discipline? Are there any resulting tensions that impact my students?</p>
    <p>As a teacher, I need to ponder these questions, and many like them, if I want to be intentionally faithful to the gospel.</p>

    <h2>How I Teach</h2>
    <p>The how is profoundly influenced by the who and the what questions. Knowing that my students are bearers of the image of God, creative, and relational, may lead me to run my classroom in a particular way that allows for those aspects to thrive. Knowing that my students struggle with a fallen nature and that they are insecure will influence how I react to them in certain situations. Understanding the grace of God and the unconditional love he has shown to sinners may inform how I discipline.</p>

    <h1>My Faithful Teaching</h1>
    <p>How does the concept of Faithful Teaching impact my classroom? Just asking that question seems a bit overwhelming. To do justice to the topic I need something that is the equivalent of a doctoral dissertation. Since time is limited and no one has volunteered to finance the venture, I will need to keep it simple. The following are just a few of the ways in which the concept of Faithful Teaching is seen in my classroom.</p>

    <h2>High Hopes and Expectations</h2>
    <p> Knowing that students are created in the image of God, and that they have the ability to think and reason, and that they have the capability of knowing right and wrong, I have high expectations for what they can do and what they can achieve in my class. But, I also know that God has given different gifts and abilities to different people. We are not all the same. The fall has also had an impact on our physical abilities. Therefore, I expect that all students will do their best, whatever that may be. I will celebrate with the student who gets high marks, but I will also celebrate with the student who works hard, regardless of the final grade.</p>

    <h2>Lots of Grace</h2>
    <p>I realize the I have been given much by my Father in heaven. "To those who are given much, much will be expected." My Father has shown so much grace to me in spite of my shortcomings. I recognize that students are in progress. They are not perfect and they require a lot of patience and grace. When a student makes a mistake, I try not to respond harshly or in anger. I try to respond to my students with graceful words and actions. When a student has a difficult time understanding the material, I try to work patiently with that student and offer support outside of class to assist. I want the student to know that he or she is valued and that they will be rewarded for hard work and persistance.</p>

    <h2>Opportunities for Creativity</h2>
    <p>My students are created in the image of God. As so, they are endowed with certain creative capacities. Though not one of my strengths, I am seeking to find more ways to allow for individuals students to be creative. I am becoming more and more aware of the value of hands on learning, project based learning, and inquiry based learning. I am trying to incorporate these things into my lessons.</p>

    <h2>Discipline With Kindness</h2>
    <p>As a result of the fall, we struggle with insecurity, selfishness, anger, rebellion, and the like. Sometimes these human struggles come out in the words or actions of my students. Sometimes, I even wrestle with these things. Crazy! Right? Discipline and correction are important. I want my students to learn about how to behave and what is good and what is not good behavior in the classroom. But I attempt to discipline in kindness. This means I do my part not to respond in anger. I may ask a student to step outside or on occasion to go to the office, but I try to do so in a calm manner and in such a way as to let the student know I am not angry with him or her.</p>

    <h2>Safe Atmosphere for Learning</h2>
    <p>I recognize that as a result of the fall, many if not all of us struggle with insecurities. It is important to provide a safe place for learning to occur. I strive to make my classes a safe place for the students. I encourage the students verbally at the beginning of the year. I encourage students to share prayer requests in class and we pray for one another. I share prayer requests and model openness to my students. If I hear a student speaking negatively about another, I will address it.</p>

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <p>I teach math and science. In some ways, the content I teach and the methods employed would look much the same as that of any other teacher. On the other hand, my worldview comes out in a number of ways throughout the year. For example, I have discussions with my students regarding whether man invented math or whether man discovered mathematical concepts and put language to what God placed into the fabric of creation.</p>

    <h1>Theological Foundation</h1>
    <p>Our claim is that how we think about these three categories is, or should be, deeply informed by Christian theology and Biblical principles.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, when we originally embarked on this journey together, we thought that there would be quite distinct and different theological questions informing each of the three categories (anthropological, epistemological, and psychological).  The more we read, thought, and discussed, we found that the grand Biblical narrative arc of the creation, the fall, redemption, and restoration provided similar questions for each category.</p>

  <div id="hiddenText" class="container-fluid textDiv">
    <p>At first we did not understand what we were seeing, which lead to some frustration due the strong overlap between the categories.  For a while we wondered if the entire discourse was mere semantics and word play, a waste of our and your time.  However, once we recognized the rich and fruitful interconnectedness between the Biblical narrative and our categories of anthropology, epistemology, and psychology, we were immediately more confidence that we were heading in the right direction.  For some of us, it gave us yet another way of thinking about the unity of truth. In retrospect, it seems so obvious.  But that is the nature of learning and discovery.</p>

    <p>Our point is that the ways in which we understand the grand Biblical narrative arc of creation, the fall, redemption, and restoration, both collectively and individually, should inform our understanding of who we teach, how we teach, and what we teach.  Notice that we are not mandating any specific understandings or positions with respect to the Biblical metanarrative.  We think there are multiple theologically sound ways to think about implications of the creation, the fall, redemption, and restoration, all of them meaningful, fruitful, and enriching to ourselves and to our students.  A good starting point for thinking about the Biblical metanarrative is Cornelius Plantinga, Engaging God’s World: A Christian Vision of Faith, Learning, and Living.</p>
 
    <h2>Creation</h2>

    <p>Plantinga observes eight implications of the doctrine of creation, and several are particularly relevant to our role as teachers.  He notes that no human being is beyond hope because the original goodness of creation implies that all of it is potentially redeemable. Everything made by God retains to some degree part of its original goodness and promise. “No human being is as good as he can be,” notes Plantinga, “but no human being is as bad as he could be either.” Furthermore, created things, including their parts and processes, while unique and at times mysterious, are also purposive and intelligible, Christians who have Scripture as a lens for viewing the world can hope to learn something of the Creator.</p>

    <p>Plantinga also notes that the reality of imago dei implies wide ranging human responsibilities, many linked to stewardship and creativity.  Furthermore, the Biblical pronouncement “let us create humankind in our own image” secures a range of human rights, not least of all personhood and human dignity. Similarly, C.S. Lewis considers the implications of seeing this “weight of glory” in our neighbors, and for us as teachers, our students.</p>

    <p>Historically and theologically understood, there are three richly overlapping aspects of imago dei.</p>

    <h2>Representational or Ontological View</h2>

    <p>The most common view of being created in the image of God understands the image as consisting of characteristics within human nature. The inner psychological and spiritual qualities of humans are associated with, perhaps even analogous to, God’s. In this way, we are representational of God. This feature of humankind distinguishes us from the rest of creation. Being like God, we reflect His nature; that is, when one looks at a human being something of the nature of God shows through which can be seen nowhere else.  This means, among other things, we are moral, relational, and spiritual beings endowed with creative, communicative, intellectual capacities.</p>

    <h2>Relational View</h2>

    <p>Another conceptualization of the image of God stresses the relational aspect of imago dei. The relational view suggests that we are most like God when it comes to our unique relational qualities.  This view emphasizes that true humanity cannot be fully described in terms of the essential or ontological structure of the human being, but must also include humanity in actual existence. That is, imago dei is defined in terms of the relationships of man with God, with his fellow man, and with the rest of creation. Thus it is our ability to engage in complex interpersonal relationships that best reflects the divine. This is most evident when the God whom man images describes himself as “love,” which is clearly dynamic and relational.</p>

    <h2>Functional View</h2>

    <p>A functional definition of being made in the image of God centers on the God-given task for humanity to rule over creation, not so much a list of characteristics or relationships.  We might think of this as being God’s representatives in the world. In Genesis, Adam received the commission to work the garden and become the stewards of God’s creation.  Just as God modeled work and purpose, He commissioned his creation to work purposefully for the maintenance and development of the created world.  Therefore, our responsibility to our creator is tied to our responsibility to the world. There is a necessary cyclical pattern to stewardship: we must be stewards in a way that we create future stewards.</p>

    <h2>The Fall</h2>

    <p>Plantinga begins his discussion of the fall with this understatement: “Human life is not the way it’s supposed to be.” As Scripture teaches and the record of human activity demonstrates, we individually and corporately continually live our lives against what’s good for us.  Why would we do that? Why would we act against the purpose of our own existence?  Why do we struggle against the fact that we belong to God and not to ourselves? Why do we deny the idea that our lives themselves have come from God and therefore we owe God our gratitude and loyalty? Why do we continually will ignorance and self-deception? The fact of the fall and the presence of evil in the world present a number of implications for us as teachers.  In particular, how do we come to grips with the knowledge that if the fallenness of creation extends far and wide then it extends into our very thinking processes? Furthermore, how do we come to grips with the realization that our understanding of the created world, the way we relate to each other including our students, the methods we use to teach, and our views of our students’ capacity to learn are all affected by this fallen state?</p>

    <h2>Redemption</h2>

    <p>Believers are united with Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit and through the exercise of faith, itself God’s gift.  In the New Testament, nobody gains union with Christ him- or herself alone. Even in private acts of devotion, meditation, and worship we are members of a worldwide and local body, joined with a whole realm of believers past, present, and future, a “cloud of witnesses.” Furthermore, baptism and communion bind us to Christ and each other, a body of people who do not necessarily get along well or even like each other very much. As Plantinga notes, originally some were Jews and some were Greeks. Some lean to the right in politics while others lean left. Some prefer contemporary church music while others long for the traditional.  Yet, somehow we all fit into Christ. What are the implications of this for our classrooms? How does our understanding of redemption guide our relationships with our students, both those who are part of the body of Christ and those that are not?  To what degree does redemption impact our understanding of and our relationship to the created world?</p>

    <h2>Restoration</h2>

    <p>Part of the redemption story is that we are not just saved to go to heaven, but have been restored for better. God is doing a particular sort of work of reconstruction in the hearts, minds and lives of believers.  As Amy Sherman states, “His story of the gospel doesn’t end with Christ’s sacrifice and our rescue (our ‘receiving our ticket to heaven’) … the conversation about salvation is linked to a conversation about discipleship.” We are not only saved from sin, hell and death, but we are saved for partnering with God in His work of restoring all things. We are to become partners with Jesus, to become “sent ones,” to join His heart and kingdom mission to promote shalom.  Plantinga observes that “in the fellowship of the Christian community, the redeemed person embarks on a life’s adventure – to discover the purposes of God and to make them her own; to discover the ways of the kingdom and to follow in those ways; to uncover the ‘mind of Christ’ and to strive to become like-minded.” Thinking along these lines, how does the task of restoration play out in who we teach, what we teach, and how we teach?</p>

    <p>We have offered a web of interconnected ideas as a gateway into thinking, discussing, and engaging what it means to be a Christian teacher. By presenting the language and vocabulary faithful teaching, our intent is to help us be intentional about our roles and responsibilities as teachers at a Christian school. In the section that follows, we will develop that language more fully as we examine in some specificity what we mean by the anthropological questions, the epistemological questions, and the psychological questions. In this way, we are proposing what we think are helpful questions, “tools” if you will, to point us in meaningful and fruitful ways to the task of intentionally faithful teaching.  

    <p>We also recognize that this model of faithful learning is not the only approach.  For example, David Smith, Susan Felch, and their colleagues at Calvin offer a compelling picture of Christian education centered on a rich web of Biblical metaphors that are deeply embedded in the historical tradition of Christian spirituality.  Other writers such as Parker Palmer and Donovan Graham envision reconstructionist (even utopian) alternatives to Christian education that arrest our attention and force us to think deeply about who, what, and how we teach.  Nevertheless, we think the language of faithful teaching captures the full range of what we do as Christian educators in the time and place into which God has placed us.

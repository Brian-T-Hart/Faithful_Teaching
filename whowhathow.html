    <h1>Who, What, How:</h1>
    <p>Anthropological, Epistemological, and Psychological.  Telos and Praxis are generally visible to our student, visitors, and us; the bottom half of the pyramid suggests activities that are not generally seen. They occur in the mind and in the heart.  They are intellectual activities we perform at our desks, while exercising, or reading at the park.  Often, they occur while on our knees before God in prayer and worship.</p>

    <p>They can be organized into three categories: Anthropological, Epistemological, and Psychological.  These categories suggest different sorts of relationships and engagement broadly conceived. We think they capture the range of things we do as Christian teachers at a Christian school.</p>

    <p>At the center is the question of “Who We Teach,” which considers the anthropological aspects of our teaching. How do we understand those people arrayed around us during class, practice, rehearsal, school activities, or lunch? What insights can we gain by examining theories of human nature? In what ways are we intentional about integrating our theories of human nature with our theological commitments, and to what degree do they influence how we relate to our students?</p>

    <p>Next is the question of “What We Teach?” Here we want to consider the epistemological concerns that inform our disciplinary tasks. Each of us has been trained in a specific academic discipline, and we have commitments to how that particular discipline frames questions, understands evidence, and constructs arguments.  In what ways are we intentional about integrating our disciplinary commitments with our theological commitments, and to what degree do we make that transparent to our students?</p>

    <p>Finally is the question of “How We Teach?”  We need to make sense of the descriptive psychological theories on how students learn. In what ways are we intentional about integrating psychological insights into how our students learn with our theological commitments, and to what degree do they actually inform the methodologies we employ in the classroom?</p>

    <p>We recognize that there is significant overlap between these categories, but we believe it is useful to separate them out as a way to be more intentional out how we approach our task as a Christian teacher.</p>

    <p id="praxisText">In the center of the pyramid is an area termed praxis: practices, methods, techniques, knowledge, and relationships.  These are the visible things that happen in the classroom, during rehearsals and performances, on the athletic fields, in Herald Hall, in the Leon Davis Event Center, in the school offices, during service projects, and at ASB events.</p> 

    <p>They are seen in our instructional methodologies and practices as they are played out with our students.  They are seen in the everyday interactions between our students and ourselves, and are made visible in our relations with students. Faithful teaching suggests both best practices as an educator and best practices as a Christian. The point is to suggest an intentionality regarding what we do in this respect.
